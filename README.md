#Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

Data Cleaning: 
     Identifying missing values, duplicates, null value then count the no.value_counts about text no.of character,no.of words & no.sentence . finally display the polt about count.

Text Preprocessing:  Transforming raw data into format that is easier to understand and process by algorithms. It involves: Lowercasing- convert all text to lowercase e.g. "Hello"->"hello" Tokenization- split the text into smaller units such as words. Removing Punctuation- Eliminate special characters and punctuation e.g. "hello!"->"hello" Removing stop words- Eliminate common words like "and","the","in",etc that don't add much meaning Stemming- reduce words to their root form e.g. "running"->"run" OR Lemmatization- converts word to their base form with meaning.

Conclusion:
"Our results show that Logistic Regression outperforms other algorithms in terms of accuracy, achieving the highest accuracy at 81%. Therefore, Logistic Regression is the best model for this dataset based on accuracy."
